# Diabetes Prediction Model

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting diabetes based on certain features. We will be using Python along with the Pandas and Scikit-learn libraries.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) available on Kaggle. It contains several features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels, along with the target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

## Setup
1. create a python virtual environment(
  <a href='https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/'>virtualenv</a> or <a href='https://www.anaconda.com/download'>anaconda</a>
):
2. Install Python and required libraries:

scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.[3] It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support-vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy. Scikit-learn is a NumFOCUS fiscally sponsored project.</p>
